# Churn-Prediction-System
Machine learning project for predicting telecom customer churn using algorithms such as Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM. Included data preprocessing, feature engineering, and class imbalance handling with SMOTETomek. Model performance optimized using Optuna-based hyperparameter tuning and evaluated with confusion matrix and F1-score.
