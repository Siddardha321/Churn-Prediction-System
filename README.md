#  Churn Prediction System

Machine learning project for predicting **telecom customer churn** using algorithms such as **Random Forest**, **Logistic Regression**, and **SVM**. Included **data preprocessing**, **feature engineering**, and **class imbalance handling** with **SMOTETomek**.  Model performance was optimized using **Optuna-based hyperparameter tuning** and evaluated with **confusion matrix** and **F1-score**.
